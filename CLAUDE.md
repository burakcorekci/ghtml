# Use Test Driven Development
1. Implement tests for the change that fail
2. Implement the simplest implementation that succeed the test cases
3. Refactor code to reach the least complex state where the code is:
   * Most maintainable
   * Extendible for future changes
   * Uses the most idiomatic approaches of the language and framework
